    <h3>Info</h3>
    <p id="tribute-info">Milo is the best dog that I have ever had, I don't know what I would do without him. Milo is currently 4 years old, almost 5. He is such a playfull and energy filled dog. One of his favorite things to do is go on walks, we cant even say the word around him thats how much he loves them. He is a little bit yappy, but that comes with all small dogs. When he is not on a walk, he loves to lay on the couch with us. His favorite toy has to be either his bone or his ball. And of course, he loves a treat.
